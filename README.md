# Charlotte Jenny Project OIM3640
 This is a repository for Charlotte Chen and Jenny Ma's Final Project for OIM 3640. 

## 1. The Big Idea

The app is to create a recipe app that is designed specifically for college students and busy employees who are not experienced with culinary and want to try out new recipes. The app will feature easy-to-do recipes that are tailored to the user's head count and personalized ingredient lists according to their preferences. Through talking to a chatbot or searching manually, users will be able to search for recipes, create a shopping list for ingredients, and find what they can do with existing ingredients at hand (users' input) . The minimum viable product (MVP) will be an app that provides basic functionalities, such as recipe search among a existing recipe API, ingredient list creation, search function in list, and chatbot.  To develop the MVP, we will utilize existing APIs for recipes. The stretch goal is to create a web app that allows users to input their data, including their dietary preferences and specialized house recipes into the big recipe database automatically.
